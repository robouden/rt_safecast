== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need this plugin? =

If you want to integrate content from your site to JavaScript applications running on other domains then the CORS standard is a way to allow this. Allowing CORS for all sites is a security problem but given you are the super admin for sites on your own network they should be trustworthy, therefore CORS can be safely activated.

= What is the difference between CORS and JSONP? =

CORS is more modern and more secure since it works _with_ the browser's same-origin policy and XmlHttpRequest objects rather than bypassing them. 

= Ok I'm sold, where can I read more about CORS? =

You can find the CORS spec here: http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/ You can learn more about how to use CORS here: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/

= What is something does not work?  =

LH Multisite CORS, and all [https://lhero.org](LocalHero) plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones). 

If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.

If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-multisite-cors/](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-multisite-cors/). I look there regularly and resolve most queries.

= What if I need a feature that is not in the plugin?  =
