Allow all cross origin requests to your WordPress site's REST API.

== Description ==

Allow all cross origin requests to your WordPress site's REST API.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Would it be a security concern to allow all? =

No. I allow it. Not allowing is a gentle request that may or may not be granted. Just like `robots.txt` cannot really stop a bot from visiting your site if a bot doesn't care. I mean, remember it's not security, it's a polite request.


== Changelog ==

= 1.0 =
* Allows all CORS.
